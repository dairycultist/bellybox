# bellybox

A lightweight, private booru software for fat female anime bellies. Client need not Javascript! 

**Feature plan:**
- bulk upload
- description
- pagination
- request deletion
- request edit
- config with port, hostname, postcode, admincode, and array of accepted tags (which is used to generate tag input html)
- thumbnail saving (ID_thumb.png, much smaller)

maybe accounts? invite-only ofc

I don't think anyone would actually use a forum for chatting here, so booru it is.
